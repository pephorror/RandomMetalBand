# RandomMetalBand
Project to search a random band from metal-archives, search for them in bandcamp, spotify, youtube or discogs. If you like the band you can save it's info in a csv file.

I used Tkinter for the GUI.

You press the top button to get info from a random band from metal-archives.
With the other buttons you can search for that random band in bandcamp, youtube, spotify or discogs.

If you like the band you cand add it to a 'bandas.csv' file to biild a database with the bands you discover.
