# RandomMetalBand
Project to get the information of a random band from metal-archives and search for that band in bandcamp, spotify, youtube or discogs. If you like the band you can save its info in a csv file.

I used Tkinter for the GUI.

Very simple GUI:
Top button to get info from a random band from metal-archives.
With the other buttons you can search for that random band in bandcamp, youtube, spotify or discogs, or save the info of the band to a csv file (it also saves the discography of the band, not only the fields that appears in the gui).

If you like the band you cand add it to a 'bandas.csv' file to biild a database with the bands you discover.
