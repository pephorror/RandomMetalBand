# RandomMetalBand

Project to get the information of a random band from metal-archives and search for that band in bandcamp, spotify, youtube, discogs, lastfm or open its site in metal-archives. If you like the band you can save it info in a csv file to don't forget about them.

Usign the lastfm API you can get similar artists to the artist you had found or saved.

Using the lastfm API you can generate a html file with a table with the charts for the most popular metal genres.

NOTE: I generated an exe file using pyinstaller but its ridiculous how heavy it is. I'd been reading some documentantion but I can't seem to be able to generate a smaller exe. Please if you read this and know how to make the file a bit lighter, contact me! :)
